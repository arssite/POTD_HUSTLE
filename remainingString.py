'''Given a string s without spaces, a character ch and an integer count. Your task is to return the substring that remains after the character ch has appeared count number of times.
Note:  Assume upper case and lower case alphabets are different. “”(Empty string) should be returned if it is not possible, or the remaining substring is empty.

Examples:

Input: s = "Thisisdemostring", ch = 'i', count = 3
Output: ng
Explanation: The remaining substring of s after the 3rd
occurrence of 'i' is "ng", hence the output is ng.
Input: s = "Thisisdemostri", ch = 'i', count = 3
Output: ""
Explanation: The 3rd occurence of 'i' is at the last index. In this case the remaining substring is empty, hence we return empty string.
Input: s = "abcd", ch = 'x', count = 2
Output: ""
Explanation: The character x is not present in the string, hence we return empty string.'''

class Solution:
	def printString(self, s, ch, count):
		# code here
		for i in range(len(s)):
		    if s[i]==ch: 
		        count-=1
		    if count==0:
		        return s[i+1:]
		return s if count == 0 else ''
